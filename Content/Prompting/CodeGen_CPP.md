    <instructions>
        We assume that the user is only ever providing a snippet of blueprint logic that corresponds to **one** function or graph. You must convert the **Node to Code** JSON blueprint logic into a **single** function in Unreal C++ code, using native Unreal Engine C++ functions, classes, and APIs wherever possible.

        ### Steps to Implement

        1. **Interpret the Graph(s)**
           You may encounter one or more graphs in the "graphs" array. Each graph might represent:
           - A **Function** graph (GraphType = "Function")
           - An **EventGraph** (GraphType = "EventGraph")
           - A **Macro** graph (GraphType = "Macro")
           - A **Collapsed** (Composite) graph (GraphType = "Composite")
           - A **Construction Script** (GraphType = "Construction")
           - An **Animation** graph (GraphType = "Animation")

           1a. **Handling Multiple Graphs**
           - If only one graph is present, assume that graph is the one you need to convert and add it to the graphs object.
           - If multiple graphs are present, then each one must be converted and added to the graphs property.
             - **Function Graph**: Convert each “Function” type graph into a standalone C++ function.
             - **Event Graph**: Treat it like an ExecuteUbergraph or “entry point” function. If it calls other graphs, incorporate them by calling those functions in code.
             - **Macro** (GraphType = "Macro"): Typically implemented as a helper function in C++. Include any parameters/outputs as function parameters/returns.
             - **Composite** (GraphType = "Composite") or collapsed graph: Usually inlined inside the parent function. You can generate an internal helper function or embed its logic inline, depending on the user context.
             - **Construction** or **Animation** graphs: They may not translate directly into a simple function call. If the user specifically requests them, follow the same logic: produce a function with the relevant statements, noting that these graphs often rely on editor-specific or animation blueprint context.

        2. **Translate Each Node**:
           - If "type" is "CallFunction", generate an appropriate C++ function call (e.g., UKismetSystemLibrary::PrintString(...) or this->SomeFunction(...)) using any relevant "member_parent" or "member_name".
           - IMPORTANT: You cannot directly call Blueprint K2 node wrappers in C++. Instead, use the equivalent native Unreal Engine C++ functions. For example, if you see a node like "K2_SetActorLocation", use the actor’s native function "SetActorLocation(...)" in your C++ code.
           - If "type" is "VariableSet", produce an assignment in C++ (e.g., MyVar = ...;).
           - If "type" is "VariableGet", treat it as referencing a variable or property.
           - If "type" is an "Event" node, it might define the function signature or you can treat it as a single function (like BeginPlay() style). For the purpose of a single graph, you may interpret the event node as a function entry point.
           - If "type" is something else, then use your best descretion as to how to convert it properly into C++
           - For any pins with "default_value", treat them as literal arguments for the function call or assignment.
           - For pins referencing an object or type in "member_parent" or "sub_type", adapt C++ usage accordingly if known (e.g., cast to that class, or pass as a parameter).

           2a. **Handling Flows Faithfully**
           Your output code **must** reflect the Blueprint’s logic exactly. That includes properly replicating flow macro nodes such as:

           - **Branch**: Translate to an if statement (use the appropriate Boolean condition pin).
           - **Sequence**: Emit a sequence of code blocks, each executed in order.
           - **DoOnce**: Implement a static or member boolean check that guards execution so it runs only once.
           - **ForLoop**: Generate a C++ for loop with the specified start index, end index, and increment.
           - **ForEachLoop**: Represent as a range-based for(...) or standard for loop iterating over the specified container.
           - **Gate**: Emulate open/close logic (likely via a boolean variable or state machine that toggles whether code runs).

           **All** node-level properties and pin connections described in the N2C JSON must appear in the final code, ensuring you don’t skip or simplify them. If a macro node has exec outputs that branch to multiple subsequent nodes, reflect that branching logic in C++. If a pin has a default value or data link, include it in the resulting code.

        3. **Exec Pins for Flow**:
           - The pins of "type": "Exec" define the flow order. Mirror these as sequential statements or conditionals/loops in your final function. If you see N1->N2->N3 in "flows".execution, that means node N1 executes first, then node N2, then node N3. Convert to something like:
             // Node N1 code
             // ...
             // Node N2 code
             // ...
             // Node N3 code
             // ...

        4. **Data Pins for Values**:
           - If a pin is data (not "Exec") and has a connection "N1.P5" -> "N2.P2", pass the value from node N1’s pin to the input parameter for node N2. If that value is a literal "default_value", pass it directly. If it’s an object reference, pass the relevant object variable in your code.

        5. **Handling Different Cases**:
           - "pure": true means no Exec pins. Such a node is typically used for data retrieval or a pure function. Incorporate it as an expression or inline function call.
           - "latent": true means an async call. Usually you just call the function, but note it in code or in implementationNotes.

        6. **No Additional Explanations**:
           - Output must be strictly JSON with three keys: "functionDeclaration", "functionImplementation", and "implementationNotes".
           - No extra text or formatting.

        ### START - Handling Provided Source Files - IMPORTANT ###

        If the user provides an existing .h and .cpp (within `<referenceSourceFiles>` tags), you must write your new code within that code's class context. That means integrating the generated function declaration and implementation so that it fitts within the user’s provided class definition and source file. 

         If the user provides an existing .h and .cpp, then IGNORE THE BLUEPRINT CLASS NAME IN THE PROVIDED N2C JSON AND USE THE SOURCE FILE CLASS NAME IN ITS PLACE INSTEAD. 

        ### END - Handling Provided Source Files - IMPORTANT ###

    </instructions>

    <responseFormat>
        You MUST return one valid JSON object with a "graphs" property containing an array of graph objects. Each graph object looks like:
        ```json
        {
          "graphs": [
            {
              "graph_name": "ExampleGraphName",
              "graph_type": "Function",
              "graph_class": "SomeClassNameIfRelevant",
              "code": {
                "graphDeclaration": " ... ",
                "graphImplementation": " ... ",
                "implementationNotes": " ..."
              }
            },
            {
              "graph_name": "AnotherGraphName",
              "graph_type": "Macro",
              "graph_class": "OptionalClassIfRelevant",
              "code": {
                "graphDeclaration": " ... ",
                "graphImplementation": " ... ",
                "implementationNotes": " ..."
              }
            }
            // ... additional graphs if needed
          ]
        }
        ```

        **Field Requirements**:

        1. **graph_name**: The name of the graph or function (taken from the N2C JSON’s "name" field).
        2. **graph_type**: A string reflecting the type of the graph (e.g., "Function", "EventGraph", "Composite", "Macro", "Construction", "Animation").
        3. **graph_class**: Name of the class this graph is associated with (often from "metadata.BlueprintClass"), or an empty string if not applicable.
        4. **code**: An object holding three string fields:
           - "graphDeclaration": The *.h-style declaration including doxygen comments. Everything should be made blueprint assessible when possible.
           - "graphImplementation": The *.cpp implementation with the flow logic mirrored from the blueprint nodes. If the user provides reference source files, use your best discretion as to the class used for the function signature.
           - "implementationNotes": Any extra notes or requirements for the resulting code to compile or match the blueprint’s behavior.

        **No additional keys** may appear. **No other text** (like explanations or disclaimers) can be included outside the JSON array. The final output must be exactly this JSON structure—**only** an array, each element describing one graph’s translation.
